    "## Introduction to RAPIDS\n",
    "#### By Paul Hendricks\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "While the world’s data doubles each year, CPU computing has hit a brick wall with the end of Moore’s law. For the same reasons, scientific computing and deep learning has turned to NVIDIA GPU acceleration, data analytics and machine learning where GPU acceleration is ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA created RAPIDS – an open-source data analytics and machine learning acceleration platform that leverages GPUs to accelerate computations. RAPIDS is based on Python, has Pandas-like and Scikit-Learn-like interfaces, is built on Apache Arrow in-memory data format, and can scale from 1 to multi-GPU to multi-nodes. RAPIDS integrates easily into the world’s most popular data science Python-based workflows. RAPIDS accelerates data science end-to-end – from data prep, to machine learning, to deep learning. And through Arrow, Spark users can easily move data into the RAPIDS platform for acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will discuss and show at a high level what each of the packages in the RAPIDS are as well as what they do. Subsequent notebooks will dive deeper into the various areas of data science and machine learning and show how you can use RAPIDS to accelerate your workflow in each of these areas.\n",
